a microservice with Spring Boot, Angular and Docker.

## Getting Started

* Make sure Java 8 JDK is installed
* Open a terminal and invoke "./gradlew build bootrun" (just "gradlew" under Windows)
* Open a Web browser at http://localhost:8080

## Travis CI
You can browse th latest Travis CI build at https://travis-ci.org/toedter/microservice-60min
